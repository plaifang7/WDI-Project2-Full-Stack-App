## Description
<p>For this project I wanted to get creative with an app idea, so I brainstormed and came up with D(og)inder. I know I have issues with finding a play mate for my dog and I know there are many people out there who also struggle with this as well. This sole purpose provided a meaning behind my ambition to finish the MVP of this app. I had some struggles, but I had tons of help from classmates, TAs and our Lead Instructor Jamie King. I learned a lot about how Express and Node.js works with this project and realized that Postman is a very valuable tool for Express. Overall, I am happy with the outcome that I have on the due date and can't wait to continue to work more on this app.  Feel Free to check the link above to see how the app works.</p>

## Approach Taken
<p>The approach I took for this project was to get the skeleton and planning together first. This meaning that I worked on my ERD, wireframes and Trello board first. I started with the ERDs the day before and added onto it on the first day of the project. Once I was able to determine my models, I was able to put my wireframe together and see what my website will look like. After I created my wireframe, I was able to move forward to my step-by-step planning in my trello board. Once all three of these steps were completed, I felt comfortable with moving forward with the back-end. In my first project, I started with the front-end because I didnt understand grid and I paid for it. This time around, I wanted to take what I learned from this experience and took the advice of my good friend Kumar and started with getting an understanding of the back-end first. I saw myself getting a grasp of the idea of creating an MVP site. I was able to figure out the full CRUD for my users and saw it project on my app right before my eyes and I really enjoyed that thoroughly. I left my charger in GA on the day before the due date and had absolutely no CSS on my site, but was at a point of full functionatlity. This caused me to rely on bootstrap for my CSS, which actually came out really nice. Overall, this project was a very tough one, but with the collaboration of my peers, I was able to get a better grasp of each concept that we went over in this project. </p>
