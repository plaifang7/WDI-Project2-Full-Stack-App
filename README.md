# Dinder
##Heroku:
* https://doginder.herokuapp.com/

<p>For this project I wanted to get creative with an app idea, so I brainstormed and came up with D(og)inder. I know I have issues with finding a play mate for my dog and I know there are many people out there who also struggle with this as well. This sole purpose provided a meaning behind my ambition to finish the MVP of this app. I had some struggles, but I had tons of help from classmates, TAs and our Lead Instructor Jamie King. I learned a lot about how Express and Node.js works with this project and realized that Postman is a very valuable tool for Express. Overall, I am happy with the outcome that I have on the due date and can't wait to continue to work more on this app.  Feel Free to check the link above to see how the app works.</p>
