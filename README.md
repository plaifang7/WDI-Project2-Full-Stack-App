# Dinder

<p>For this project I wanted to get creative with an app idea, so I brainstormed and came up with D(og)inder. I know I have issues with finding a play mate for my dog and I know there are many people out there who also struggle with this as well. This sole purpose provided a meaning behind my ambition to finish the MVP of this app. I had some struggles, but I had tons of help from classmates, TAs and our Lead Instructor Jamie King.   </p>
